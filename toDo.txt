1. Work on weighting subtraction in cost model. Potentially by 1.5.
2. Include a way for Mini Zinc to consider powers of 3 when optimizing. Powers of 3
   must be more expensive in cost model
3. Automatically graph the results in python
3. Compare the realtive frequency of good optimizations in the results of normal cost model vs k+1 model
4. Familiarize with division by constant: https://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/gac1/pubs/TheoISCAS12.pdf
